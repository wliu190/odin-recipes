        <h1>Lasagne</h1>
        <a href="../index.html">Back</a>
        <p>This is my classic lasagne recipe! First inspired by
            Bon Appetit, it now just takes whatever form I fancy. 
        </p>
        <p>For this recipe, you'll need:
            <ul>
                <li>Mince (500g)</li>
                <li>Bacon (optional, finely diced)</li>
                <li>Carrot (one, finely diced)</li>
                <li>Onion (one, finely diced)</li>
                <li>Celery (one, finely diced)</li>
                <li>Tomato paste</li>
                <li>Tinned chopped tomatoes (350 g)</li>
                <li>Milk</li>
                <li>Flour</li>
                <li>Lasagne sheets</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The recipe consists of three stages: making the ragu,
            making the bechamel, and finally, assembly.
        </p>
        <h3>Making the meat sauce</h3>
        <p>This component takes the longest, but is where all the 
            flavour comes from!
            <ol>
                <li>Fry off the bacon, then the mince</li>
                <li>Add onion, carrot, and celery and fry off</li>
                <li>Deglaze with white wine, then add tomato paste</li>
                <li>Add beef stock and milk to cover, add herbs</li>
                <li>Simmer for at least an hour</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>Making the bechamel sauce</h3>
        <p>
            The bechamel sauce is nothing special, but you can
            add parmesan to make it better!
            <ol>
                <li>Melt a knob of butter</li>
                <li>Add a tablespoon or two of flour, fry off</li>
                <li>Slowly whisk in milk, adding 500 mL or so</li>
                <li>Bring to boil, then let simmer to thicken</li>
                <li>Remove from heat (add cheese now if desired)</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>Assembly</h3>
        <p>This is the fun part! Start with a layer of ragu 
            and bechamel and layer lasagne sheets over. Repeat this 
            process until you've run out of something (or space!).
            The last layer should be lasagne sheets with bechamel on top, 
            sprinkled with parmesan. 
        </p>
        <p>Put in the oven for 45 mins at 180C. Let cool for 15 minutes (essential!)
            and enjoy!
